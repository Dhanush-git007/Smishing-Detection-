 Smishing (SMS Phishing) Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a Machine Learning–based system to detect smishing (SMS phishing) messages using classical NLP techniques such as Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM. The goal is to build a fast, lightweight, and highly interpretable solution that can classify SMS messages as phishing or legitimate.
